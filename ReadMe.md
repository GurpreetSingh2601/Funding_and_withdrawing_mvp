This is an MVP application through which we can interact with blockchain basic functionalities such as getting the account balance, funding, withdrawing of funds and connecting our app with the browser wallet such as MetaMask.

Note* This app requires FundMe.sol smart contract (available on my repo hardhat_fund_me inside contracts folder) to be published on blockchain (such as Hardhat in your local machine) before use of this app's functionality.

Warning - Try this app using only fake ethers and Always remember to keep your wallet address private :)
